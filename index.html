            Hi, I'm Liam Dinh! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            With over seven years of experience as a small boba tea shop owner, I have honed my entrepreneurial and customer service skills while managing a successful business. Prior to my journey in the food and beverage industry, I worked as an Applications Engineer at Actel (now MicroChip) after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley. I later transitioned into the role of Quality Assurance Engineer at Verizon, where I spent three years ensuring the reliability and performance of software applications.

            Despite my early career in technology, I found myself drawn to new challenges outside of the tech world. However, my passion for technology, particularly web development, has been reignited. I am now actively learning and refining my skills in web development, with the goal of transitioning into a professional role in the industry. My background in engineering, combined with my hands-on business experience, equips me with a unique perspective on problem-solving, user experience, and innovation.

            I am eager to leverage my technical foundation and newfound enthusiasm for web development to contribute to dynamic and forward-thinking teams.

            <h3>Task Manager Web App</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a simple task manager web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and track tasks. The app was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with local storage to save user tasks persistently. It features a modern, intuitive user interface with interactive buttons and animations. The project helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling. By implementing local storage, I gained insight into data persistence in client-side web applications.</li>

              <li>Designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my web development skills and projects. The website features a clean, responsive layout with a navigation menu, project gallery, and an about section. I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The project also includes a contact form with basic validation using JavaScript. Through this project, I enhanced my knowledge of front-end web development and practiced optimizing website performance for a seamless user experience.</li>

            <h3>Weather Dashboard</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Created a weather dashboard that fetches real-time weather data from an external API and displays the information dynamically. The application allows users to search for a city and view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. I used JavaScript to make API requests and update the UI accordingly. The project introduced me to working with asynchronous operations and JSON data handling. Additionally, I focused on making the website mobile-friendly with responsive design techniques.</li>
